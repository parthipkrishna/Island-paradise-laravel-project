                  </div>

                  <div class="entry-content mt-4">The procurement and sale of marine products involve sourcing,processing, and distributing seafood like fish, shellfish, and seaweed through fishing,aquaculture, or harvesting. Sustainable practices protect marine ecosystems while meeting consumer demand. Products are processed for freshness—cleaned, frozen, or packaged—and sold via seafood markets, grocery stores, restaurants, and direct sales. Ensuring quality control, food safety, and sustainability is crucial. Supporting local fishing communities and ethical practices strengthens the supply chain and meets global demand responsibly.</div>
